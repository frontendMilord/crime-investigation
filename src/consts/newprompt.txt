CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

DIALOGUE TREES:
- Each person should have 8-16 dialogue trees
- Create branching paths: early questions unlock later ones via "followUps"
- Use "requiresEvidence" for questions that need analyzed evidence
- Use "requiresPerson" + "requiresResponse" for cross-interrogation (confronting with other people's statements)
- Some trees should be available immediately, others locked behind requirements
- Include "revealsDetail" for important clues discovered through questioning
- Design trees so asking questions in different orders reveals different information

CONTRADICTIONS:
- Each suspect should have 2-3 potential contradictions
- Format: "tree1-r1" means response r1 from tree1
- Contradictions should be subtle - require player to notice inconsistencies
- Only suspects need contradictions, witnesses don't

PEOPLE TYPES:
- type: "suspect" = potential culprits (3-4 people)
- type: "witness" = witnesses who provide information (2-3 people)
- Suspects: more complex dialogue trees, contradictions, motives
- Witnesses: simpler trees, provide observations and tips
- Use "available: false" + "availability: evidence-id" to lock witnesses behind evidence collection

EVIDENCE:
- 8-12 pieces of evidence across 3-4 locations
- Use "hidden: true" + "unlockedBy: evidence-id" for sequential discovery (finding X reveals Y)
- analysisResult should contain specific, useful information
- Some evidence should point to wrong suspects (red herrings)
- Set timeToProcess for each piece of evidence in seconds based on how long it takes to process (from 5 to 300, total time to proccess should be less than half of timeLimit)
- Link evidence to dialogue trees (people react to being confronted with evidence)

SCENE:
- if evidence is hidden and needs to be unlocked it still needs to be included in scene evidenceIds 

PHONE RECORDS:
- 4-6 calls showing timeline and relationships
- 4-6 texts with actual message content
- Include incriminating messages, timeline clues, suspicious communications
- Must be unlocked by collecting/analyzing phone evidence

BREAKING NEWS:
- 2-3 news items that unlock during investigation
- Triggers: "evidence-analyzed-X" or "person-interviewed-X" (replace X with number)
- Should reveal context, backstory, or new angles on the case

GENERAL TIPS:
- Make the mystery solvable but not obvious
- Include red herrings and false leads
- Ensure contradictions are catchable through careful questioning
- Create realistic motives for all suspects
- Timeline should be consistent and verifiable
- The culprit should have means, motive, and opportunity
- Design so player must collect evidence AND interrogate strategically to solve
- timeLimit is optional (in seconds:900-3600), omit for unlimited time
