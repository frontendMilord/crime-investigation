IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Create 3-4 suspects with complex relationships
- Include 6-10 pieces of evidence across 3-4 locations
- Use "hidden": true and "unlockedBy": "evidence-id" for sequential discovery
- Each suspect should have 5-7 questions including evidence/suspect confrontations
- Phone records should include both calls and revealing text messages
- Some witnesses locked behind evidence using "availability": "evidence-id"
- Breaking news triggers: "evidence-analyzed-X" or "suspect-interrogated-X"
- Evidence analysis should reveal crucial information
- Make some evidence point to wrong suspects (red herrings)
- timeLimit is optional (in seconds), omit for unlimited time
